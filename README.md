# Feelings
Autism Appjam

According to the National Autistic Society, individuals who have autism suffer from sensory sensitivity. 
This implies that people with autism are socially challenged as they can express themselves inappropriately or 
inaccurately under a certain state of affairs. Among these expressions are their emotions.

Feeling?
Goal: Make it easier for children with Autism to communicate their feelings to their parents. They can select pictures on a smartphone to let mom, dad, a babysitter, or an aunt/uncle know what they’re feeling.
E.g. if they’re happy, sad, angry, hungry, etc.
For example, if a child feels angry, they can press the “angry” picture. It will send a text to mom or dad with the text “I am angry >:(“ to them. The mom or dad can then go to the child in real life and ask what’s wrong.
